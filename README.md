# Code Challenge – Possible Solution v1.0

This solution was written in Visual Studio 2019.
You will need Cypress to use it.
Follow the instructions below to start the test sequences.

- Download and install Cypress via `npm install cypress --save-dev` command in CLI.
- For futher instructions see [Installing Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress#npm-install).
- After successful installation you can start Cypress via `.\node_modules\.bin\cypress open`.
- In Cypress look for `priceConfigurator_spec.js` and run it.
- Now you should see the test running for the product configurator on [CrowdDesk's website](https://www.crowddesk.de) in a just opend browser window.
- Hopefully, all test scenarios will pass without errors …
